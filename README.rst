Natural language processing for habitual error detection
=========

Parkinson’s Disease can be understood as a disorder of motor habits. A prediction of this theory is that early stage Parkinson’s patients will display fewer errors caused by interference from previously over-learned behaviours. We test investigate this prediction in the domain of skilled typing, where actions are easy to record and errors easy to identify.

Goal
--------

Design an easy and simple test that would give early warning that habitual control is starting to degrade.
